SFML examples
=============

Original SFML examples running with biicode.

Description
-----------

These examples show how to use the SFML library with biicode thanks to the [`manu343726/sfml`](https://www.biicode.com/manu343726/manu343726/sfml/master) block which provides the SFML library
precompiled and ready to use.

*Both the examples and the SFML block are under development, please contact us at the biicode forum if you experience any issue. Thanks!*
